## Median of two sorted arrays coding challenge
> Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

## Constraints
- contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.

## Example I
```Python
 Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
 Output: 2.00000
 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
```
## Example II
```Python
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
```
