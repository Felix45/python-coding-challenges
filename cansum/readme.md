## CanSum Coding challenge
> Write a function `canSum` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments. The function
should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to generate the targetSum using numbers from the array.

## Constraints
- You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.
- You may assume that all input numbers are nonnegative

## Examples
```
  canSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7]) => true
  canSum(7, [2, 4]) => false
```
