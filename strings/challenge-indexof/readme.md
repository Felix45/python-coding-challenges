## Occurrence of a string coding challenge
> Given a string `str`, get the indices of a substring `sub` in the string.

## Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
- `str` consist of printable ASCII characters.

## Example 1
```Python
Input: s = "This is a dish', 'h'"
Output: [1, 13]
```
Explanation: The letter `h` occurs at index `1` and `13` in the above string.

## Example 2
```Python
Input: s = "This is a dish", "is"
Output: [2, 5, 11]
```
Explanation: The sub string `is` occurs at index `2`, `5` and `11` in the above string.
