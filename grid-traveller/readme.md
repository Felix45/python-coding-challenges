## Grid traveller coding challenge
> Say that you are a traveller on a `2D` grid. You begin in the top-left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner. You may only move down
> or right.In how many ways can you travel to the goal in a grid with dimensions m * n. Write a function `grid_traveller(m,m)` that calculates this.


## Examples
```Python
  grid_traveler(2,3) => 3
  grid_traveler(1,1) => 1
  grid_traveler(0,1) => 0
```
