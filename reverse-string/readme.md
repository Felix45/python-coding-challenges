## Reverse String Coding challenge
> Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.
**You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.**

## Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.

## Example 1
```Python
  Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
  Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
Explanation: "anagram" and "nagram" have equal letter frequencies.

## Example 2
```Python
  Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
  Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
