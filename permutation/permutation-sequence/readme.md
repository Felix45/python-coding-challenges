## Permutation Sequence Coding challenge
> The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains a total of `n!` unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 3:`

`"123"`

`"132"`

`"213"`

`"231"`

`"312"`

`"321"`

Given `n` and `k`, return the `kth` permutation sequence.

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 9`
- `1 <= k <= n!`

## Example 1
```Python
  Input: n = 3, k = 3
  Output: "213"
```

## Example 2
```Python
  Input: n = 4, k = 9
  Output: "2314"
```

## Example 3
```Python
  Input: n = 3, k = 1
  Output: "123"
```
