## howSum Coding challenge
> Write a function `howSum` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments. The function
should return an array containing any combinations of elements that add up to exactly the target sum. If there is no combination that adds up to the target sum,
then return null.

## Constraints
- You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.
- You may assume that all input numbers are nonnegative
- If there are multiple combinations possible, you may return any single combination

## Examples
```
  howSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7]) => [3, 4]
  howSum(7, [2, 4]) => null
  howSum(300, [7, 14]) => null
```
